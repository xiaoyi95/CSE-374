This program implement T9 predictive text, a text input mode developed originally for cell phones and still used for numeric keypads. Each number from 2-9 on the keypad represent three or four letters, the number 0 represents a space, and 1 represents a set of symbols such as { , . ! ? } etc. The numbers from 2-9 represent letters.It reads in a dictionary file (FILE) that contains a list of words. Translate each word in the dictionary into its numeric key sequence, then add the key sequence to your trie, with the word at the end of the path corresponding to the digits. If a word with the same numeric sequence already exists in the trie, add the new word to the trie as a link to a new node with an edge labeled '#' instead of one of the digits 2-9.

Once the program has read the dictionary and built the trie containing the words in it, it should start an interactive session. The user should be able to type numbers and the program should print out the word corresponding to the sequence of numbers entered. Your program should use the numbers typed by the user to traverse the trie that has already been created, retrieve the word, and print it to the screen. If the user then enters '#', the program should print the next word in the trie that has the same numeric value, and so forth. The user can also type a number followed by one or more '#' characters - this should print the same word that would be found by typing the number and individual '#' characters on separate input lines.
